                   group signature schemes, identity escrow schemes and
                   anonymous credential systems. The ID-based ring
                   signature scheme and the group signature scheme have
                   very short signature sizes. The size of our group
                   signatures with membership revocation is only half
                   the size of those in the well-known ACJT00 scheme,
                   which does not provide membership revocation. The
                   schemes do not require trapdoor, so system parameters
                   can be shared by multiple groups belonging to
                   different organizations. All schemes are provably
                   secure in formal models. We generalize the definition
                   of accumulators and provide formal models for
                   ID-based ad-hoc anonymous identification schemes and

                   encryption function (such as DES) is described which
                   is as secure as the underlying encryption function --
                   the security does not depend on the difficulty of
                   factoring and the high computational costs of modular
                   arithmetic are avoided. The signature system can sign
                   an unlimited number of messages, and the signature
                   size increases logarithmically as a function of the
                   number of messages signed. Signature size in a
                   `typical' system might range from a few hundred bytes
                   to a few kilobytes, and generation of a signature

                   computation, where both a verifier and a prover
                   observe a stream of n elements x1,x2,{\ldots},xnand
                   the verifier can later delegate some computation over
                   the stream to the prover. The prover must return the

                   the verifier can only keep small local state (e.g.,
                   logarithmic) which must be updatable in a streaming

  abstract =      {Based on the notion of accumulators, we propose a new
                   cryptographic scheme called universal accumulators.
                   This scheme enables one to commit to a set of values
                   using a short accumulator and to efficiently compute
                   a membership witness of any value that has been
                   accumulated. Unlike traditional accumulators, this
                   scheme also enables one to efficiently compute a
                   nonmembership witness of any value that has not been
                   accumulated. We give a construction for universal
                   accumulators and prove its security based on the
                   strong RSA assumption. We further present a
                   construction for dynamic universal accumulators; this
                   construction allows one to dynamically add and delete
                   inputs with constant computational cost. Our
                   construction directly builds upon Camenisch and
                   Lysyanskaya's dynamic accumulator scheme. Universal
                   accumulators can be seen as an extension to dynamic
                   accumulators with support of nonmembership witness.
                   We also give an efficient zero-knowledge proof
                   protocol for proving that a committed value is not in
                   the accumulator. Our dynamic universal accumulator
                   construction enables efficient membership revocation

  abstract =      {We put forward the study of a new primitive that we
                   call Vector Commitment (VC, for short). Informally,
                   VCs allow to commit to an ordered sequence of q
                   values (m1, . . . , mq) in such a way that one can
                   later open the commitment at specific positions
                   (e.g., prove that mi is the i-th committed message).
                   For security, Vector Commitments are required to
                   satisfy a notion that we call position binding which
                   states that an adversary should not be able to open a
                   commitment to two different values at the same
                   position. Moreover, what makes our primitive
                   interesting is that we require VCs to be concise,
                   i.e. the size of the commitment string and of its
                   openings has to be independent of the vector length.},
