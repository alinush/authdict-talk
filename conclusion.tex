    \frametitle{Conclusion}
    Catalano-Fiore VCs~\cite{CF13} and their extensions~\cite{LM19,CFG+20} keep on giving!\pause\\
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Cross-incremental aggregation (for dictionaries w/ different params)\pause\\
        \item ADs with strong-key binding for applications beyond stateless validation\pause\\
        \item Append-only proofs\pause\\
        \item Non-membership proofs\pause\\
    \end{itemize}
    Be sure to also read~\cite{AR20} for how to remove update keys!\pause\\
    \vspace{1em}
    What else can we do with CF VCs?
